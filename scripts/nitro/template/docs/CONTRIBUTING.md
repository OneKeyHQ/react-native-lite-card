# Contributing

## Development workflow

To get started with the project, run `yarn` in the root directory to install the required dependencies:

```sh
yarn
```

## Scripts

The [package.json](./package.json) file contains various scripts for common tasks:

- `yarn typecheck`: Type-check files with TypeScript.
- `yarn lint`: Lint files with ESLint.
- `yarn test`: Run unit tests with Jest.
- `yarn clean`: Clean build folders.
- `yarn prepare`: Prepare the library by building it.

## Sending a pull request

> **Working on your first pull request?** You can learn how from this _free_ series: [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://app.egghead.io/playlists/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

When you're sending a pull request:

- Prefer small pull requests focused on one change.
- Verify that linters and tests are passing.
- Review the documentation to make sure it looks good.
- Follow the pull request template when opening a pull request.
- For pull requests that change the API or implementation, discuss with maintainers first by opening an issue.
